/*! \ingroup modbus
 * \brief Modbus serial transmission modes (RTU/ASCII).
 *
 * Modbus serial supports two transmission modes. Either ASCII or RTU. RTU
 * is faster but has more hardware requirements and requires a network with
 * a low jitter. ASCII is slower and more reliable on slower links (E.g. modems)

 * registers should be updated and reading means that the modbus protocol
 * stack needs to know the current register values.
